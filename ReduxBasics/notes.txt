Question 1 - What is redux?
ans - A state management system for cross-component or app-wide state

Question 2 - React vs Redux?
ans - 1. In more complex apps, using React Context can lead to  deeply nested
      or "fat" "Context Provider" components
      2. React Context is not optimized for high-frequency state changes

In Redux component does not change the state it will subscribe to the central
data(state) store and if any change in state occurs all components get notified 
by the Central data(state) store, State manipulation is done by reducer function,
